irritating how time bar obscures bottom half of video.
a web extension could scale video such that this doesn't happen.
more advanced could scale dynamicaly such that when controls are not vidible, video is fullscreen.
generally screen and video are 16:9. ideally should adapt to when this is not the case.

would especially like this on phone! possibly with moving video up a bit, so larger black bar on bottom (where controls appear)
